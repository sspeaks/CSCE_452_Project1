PROJECT 1 

ROBOT ARM WITH PAINTING CAPABILITIES


In order to compile our project, you will be required to install extra libraries. These libraries are the Glut working directory, and the GLUI working directory.

Both GLUT and GLUI can be found and installed through the following link:
http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs553/gettingglut.html

If you prefer to build your own libraries, the Glui project can be found at the following link:
http://glui.sourceforge.net/

The dependencies for your VS project have to be altered as well. Under Linker -> dependencies (glut32.lib, glui32.lib, opengl.lib) must all be added.
NOTE: this is already done in the included project from our webpage

With all of these in place, open The file and run the debugger, the project will run as instructed.
